    "Your task is to compute the number of target values t in the interval [-10000,10000] (inclusive) such that there are distinct numbers **_x, y_** in the input file that satisfy **_x + y = t_**. (NOTE: ensuring distinctness requires a one-line addition to the algorithm from lecture.)\n",

    "**Conclusion:** The input data consist of large negative and positive numbers. The max of negatives = -87405, the min of positives = 112177. The positives and negatives are approximately equally populated and divided into two subarrays L1 and L2. If we want a sum of two numbers x+y to be in the range -10000 to +10000 (i.e. comparably small numbers), than inevitably x should negative and y positive, or vice versa. It means we can iterate x only in the negative subarray L1 and look up y in the positive subarray L2 within the interval -x-10000 to -x+10000. So we need only one traversal of x over L1 with mostly constant time lookups into L2 (i.e. mostly no or very few items y in L2 in the range -x-10000 to -x+10000).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** My first implementation was based on the traversal of x over the whole dataset with lookups of y=t-x in a hash table for each t in the range -10000, 10000. It means 1e6 x 20e3 = 20e9 or 20 billion lookups! It produced the correct result, but the code run over 8300 sec (2.3 hours). The current implementation produces the correct answer in less than a second!!!"
