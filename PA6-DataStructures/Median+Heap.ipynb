    "The goal of this problem is to implement the \"Median Maintenance\" algorithm (covered in the Week 5 lecture on heap applications). The text file contains a list of the integers from 1 to 10000 in unsorted order; you should treat this as a stream of numbers, arriving one by one. Letting Xi denote the i-th number of the file, the k-th median Mk is defined as the median of the numbers X1, ..., Xk. (So, if k is odd, then Mk is ((k+1)/2)th smallest number among X1, ..., Xk; if k is even, then Mk is the (k/2)th smallest number among X1, ..., Xk.)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the box below you should type the sum of these 10000 medians, modulo 10000 (i.e., only the last 4 digits). That is, you should compute (M1+M2+M3+...+M10000) mod 10000.\n",
    "\n",
    "OPTIONAL EXERCISE: Compare the performance achieved by heap-based and search-tree-based implementations of the algorithm."
